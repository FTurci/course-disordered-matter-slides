## Today

- **Characterisation of colloids**
    - Static (pair) corrleations
    - Diffusive dynamics


## Pairwise interactions


True colloidal systems can be complex:

- charges
- shape deformability/swelling
- instabilities of the components

Their theoretical description focuses on **essential ingredients**.

A simplifying assumption is that the potential energy of a collection of colloids is purely **pairwise**

$$
U_N\left(\mathbf{r}^N\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^N V\left(r_i j\right)=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} V\left(r_{i j}\right)
$$

where $V(r_{ij})$ is the pairwise, radial interaction potential that only depends on the distance between particle centres $r_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j$.

## Pairwise interactions and pair correlations

- For such systems, all the thermodynamic properties are solely encoded in the **pairwise correllations**.

You have already seeen such corrleations in other contexts (Ising model, lattice gas).

The key pair correlation is the real space **radial distribution function**:

$$
g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho N}\left\langle\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i} \delta\left(\left|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j\right|-r\right)\right\rangle
$$

The free energy can then be written as 
$$
\frac{F_{\mathrm{ex}}}{k_B T}=2 \pi \rho N \int_0^{\infty}[g(r) \ln g(r)-g(r)+1] r^2 d r+\frac{\rho N}{2 k_B T} \int V(r) g(r) d^3 r
$$

and you should be able to read out a part very reminiscent of an (information-theoretical) entropy and one reminiscent of an internal energy.

## Radial distribution function

## Radial distribution function

::: {.incremental}

- The radial distribution function $g(r)$ is related to the average local density at a distance $r$ from a reference particle:

- To formally derive this, consider a system of $N$ particles in volume $V$ with average density $\rho = N/V$. The local density at a distance $r$ from a reference particle is defined as
$$
\langle \rho(r) \rangle = \left\langle \sum_{j \neq i} \delta\left(|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| - r\right) \right\rangle
$$
Averaging over all particles and normalizing by the bulk density $\rho$ gives the radial distribution function:
$$
g(r) = \frac{1}{\rho N} \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i} \delta\left(|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| - r\right) \right\rangle = \frac{\langle \rho(r) \rangle}{\rho}
$$

    where $\langle \rho(r) \rangle$ is the average density at distance $r$ from a particle, and $\rho$ is the bulk density.

## Radial distribution function

-   For an **ideal gas**, $g(r) = 1$ everywhere (no correlations).
-   For **hard spheres**, $g(r) = 0$ for $r < \sigma$ (no overlap), and $g(r)$ shows oscillations at higher $r$ due to packing effects.

Hard spheres in 3D are not exactly solvable! We only have perturbative solutons to hard spheres
:::

- The $g(r)$ is the central object of (equilibrium) liquid state theory
- Correlations between two particles $1$ and $2$ in a fluid to have two possible origins
    -   a **direct** correlation between the two particles, mediated by direct interactions (e.g. collisions) between 1 and 2.
    -   an **indirect correlation**, mediated by other particles in the fluid




## Direct and indirect correlations


- The $g(r)$ contains **both**.
- We can assume the existence of a correlation function that instead only incl;udes the **direct** part and call it $c(r)$. Then a hierarchy exists

$$
h\left(r_{12}\right)=c\left(r_{12}\right)+\rho \int c\left(r_{13}\right) h\left(r_{32}\right) d \mathbf{r}_3
$$

where $h(r) = g(r)-1$. This is the **Ornstein-Zernicke integral equation** between particles 1,2 and 3.

Both $h(r)$ and $c(r)$ are unknwon in principle. One needs an additional condition to fix box: these are **physical closures** leading to approximations.

## Percus-Yevick approximation

A common closure is the **Percus-Yevick approximation**.

$$
c(r)=[1+h(r)]\left[1-e^{\beta U(r)}\right]
$$


This closure interpolates between the hard-core exclusion (for $U(r) \to \infty$, $c(r) \to 0$ inside the core) and the ideal gas limit (for $U(r) = 0$, $c(r) = 0$).

The result (semi) analytical. For hard spheres, it allows to calculate the g(r) accurately in a wide range of packing fractions

## Structure factor

The real-space correlations and relations have their reciprocal (*Fourier* space) counterparts.



The structure factor is defined as 

$$
S(k)=1+\rho \int[g(r)-1] e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} d \mathbf{r}
$$

Isotropicity in 3D simplifies the expression to 

$$
S(k)=1+4 \pi \rho \int_0^{\infty} r^2[g(r)-1] \frac{\sin (k r)}{k r} d r
$$

- Radial distribution functions $\to$ easily accessed in **confocal experiments** (large colloids)
- Structure factors $\to$ immediately accessed via **scattering experiments**

## Structure factor

Inteestingly, reciprocal space simplifies integral equations such as Ornstein-Zernicke

$$
\tilde{h}(k)=\frac{\tilde{c}(k)}{1-\rho \tilde{c}(k)}
$$

allowing one to read the direct correlation function directly from scattering data, as $tilde{h}(k)=$ can be identified with the structure factor.

##  Dynamics: single vs collective displacements

The thermal motion of individual colloids is often well modeled via the **Langevin equation**

$$
m \frac{d \vec{v}}{d t}=-\gamma \vec{v}+\vec{\eta}(t)
$$

Coarse-graining over small volumes (and short times) gives us access to the local density $\rho(\mathbf{r},t)$ which obeys a **diffusion equation**

$$
\frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}=D \nabla^2 \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

The diffusivity is linked to the microscopic Langevin paramters via *fluctuation-dissipation*

$$
D=\frac{k_B T}{\gamma}
$$

(where the friction is the dissipation and the random force is the fluctuations).

## Diffusion equation: macroscopic picture

It is possible to (re)-derive the diffusion equation solely from macroscopic requirements. We have a macroscopic density $\rho(r,t)$ and a macroscpic flux $\vec{J}(r,t)$

- **continuity**: there is no mass loss in the dynamics

$$
\frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)=0
$$
where the divergence $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ represents the net outflow of particles from a given region due to the flux $\mathbf{J}$.

- **Fick's law** : we assume the flow is a gradient field of the density, flowing from high to low density

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)=-D \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

It is immediate to combine the two to obtain the diffusion equation

$$
\frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}=D \nabla^2 \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

## Measuring diffusion coefficients

The distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r},t)$ encodes all the information about the motion of an ensemble.

Often, less is sufficient to characterise the diffusion. The second moment of the displacements (the mean squared displacement) provides this information. In $d$ dimensions
$$
\left\langle \left| \mathbf{r}(t) - \mathbf{r}(t_0) \right|^2 \right\rangle = 2 d D t
$$

Hence $D$ can be extracted from linear fits to the MSD.

## Hidden assumptions

- We have been considering ensembles of particles microscopically governed by the Langevin equation
- We did not comment on the inter-particle interactions and assumed that the properties of the thermal bath determine the diffusivity $D$. In reality, interactions between particles can lead to deviations from simple diffusion, especially at higher concentrations, where collective effects and hydrodynamic interactions become important.
