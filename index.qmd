# Complex Disordered Systems

Welcome to the course materials for **Complex Disordered Systems**. This course explores the fascinating world of soft matter, with a particular focus on colloidal systems and their emergent properties.

## Course Overview

This course covers the fundamental principles of disordered matter, entropy-driven phenomena, and the physics of colloidal systems. Through these materials, you'll explore how simple interactions can lead to complex emergent behavior.
