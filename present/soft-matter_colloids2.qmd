True hard spheres do not exist. Colloidal hard spheres approximate the behaviour in many ways

## Hard spheres


Idealised hard spheres are impenetrable objects. 

They are characterised by the simplest of the potentials.

## Phase behaviour of hard spheres

For a sphere of diameter $\sigma$, enormous simplification of the Boltzmann factor:

$$
e^{-\beta U(r)} = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } r < \sigma \\
1 & \text{if } r \geq \sigma
\end{cases}
$$

This simplification arises because the potential \( U(r) \) is either infinite (forbidden region) or zero (allowed region).

For this reason, they hard spheres are **entropy driven**.

Constructing partition functions is then just counting **counting valid configurations**, linking geometry to thermodynamics.


- A good example:  **Asakura-Oosawa** depletion, that we have already seen.

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
Valid configurations are **sphere packings**:

- The only relevant control parameter is the **volume fraction** $\phi$, defined as:

$$
\phi = \frac{\pi}{6} \rho \sigma^3
$$

where $\rho=N/V$ is the number density.
:::

## Phase diagram of hard spheres
:::{.nonincremental}
Since we have a single control parameter, the pahse diagram is one-dimensional.

Changing temeprature is immaterial to the free energy: it is a simple rescaling factor.

It is intuitive to guess the **low density limit** of hard spheres:

- few spheres in a box should behave similalry to an ideal gas


It is harder to guess the **high density limit**

We will gradually build our understanding from low to dense packing.

![Hard spheres have a single control parameter, the packing fraction.](./figs/hsQ.png)

:::


## Low packing fractions

When treating the Asakura-Osawa depletion we introduced the **excluded volume**. It is also also key for hard spheres.

- The distance of closest approach between two identical spheres is $\sigma$, which corresponds to the diameter of the spheres. The excluded volume of one particle is $$v_{\rm ex} =4\pi\sigma^3/3$$


- At low densities, hard spheres are isolated and so no overlaps occcur and the accesible volume for N spheres is  $$V_{\rm accessible} = V-Nv_{\rm ex}$$

- For phase behaviour, we need the thermodyanamic potential.  At constant volume and number of particles, the parition function is a measure of the accessible volume $$
\mathcal{Z} = \frac{1}{N! \Lambda^{3N}} \int_{V_{\rm accessible}} d\mathbf{r}_1 \ldots d\mathbf{r}_N$$ 

    where $\Lambda$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda = h/\sqrt{2\pi mk_B T}$. 

    Mass and temperature are factorising out.


## Low packing fractions: entropy

We integrate over valid (**non-overlapping**) configurations such that  $|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| \geq \sigma$ for all $i \neq j$. This yields
$$\mathcal{Z} = \dfrac{(V-Nv_{\rm ex}/2)^N}{N!\Lambda^{3N}},$$

with the $1/2$ factor coming from the fact that we avoid double counting the excluded volume of pairs.

- We immediately obtain the entropy as $$S = k_B \ln \mathcal{Z} = k_B \left[ N \ln(V - N v_{\rm ex}/2) - \ln N! - 3N \ln \Lambda \right]$$

- Via Stirling approximation  $\ln N! = N\ln N -N$  we get $$S = k_B \left[ N \ln(V - N v_{\rm ex}/2) - (N \ln N - N) - 3N \ln \Lambda \right]$$

- This can be rewritten as  $$S = N k_B \left[ \ln\left( \frac{V - N v_{\rm ex}/2}{N \Lambda^3} \right) + 1 \right]$$


## Low packing fraction: equation of state

The **equation of state** links the  three relevant thermodynamics variables $P,T$ and $\phi$

$$P = -\left(\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{N,T} =T\left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{N,T}= \dfrac{k_B T }{v-v_{\rm ex}/2}$$

This expression can be simplified (do it as an exercise) to obtain the equation of state

$$Z_{\rm comp}= \dfrac{PV}{Nk_BT}=\dfrac{1}{1-4\phi} \quad (\phi\ll 1)$$

where $Z_{\rm comp}$ is **compressibility factor** (to not be confused with the partition function).

For small $\phi$ we have 

$$Z_{\rm comp} =\dfrac{PV}{Nk_BT} =  1+4\phi+O(\phi^2)$$

:::{.callout-note appearance="small"}
Inspect this term and recognise that this illustrates that the dilute limit is an ideal gas + a correction.
:::

## Virial expansion

The expression $Z_{\rm comp} = 1+4\phi+O(\phi^2)$ is just the simplest form of the more generic **virial expansion**, the perturbative series 

$$Z_{\rm comp}= 1 + B_2 \rho + B_3 \rho^2+ \dots$$

The $B_2, B_3, \dots$ are known as **virial coeffcients** and for non-hard-sphere systems they also depend on temperature,  $B_2(T), B_3(T),\dots$

They encode **correlations** (pairs, triplets and so on). In a genric setting

$$
Z_N=\frac{1}{N!\Lambda^{3 N}} \int \cdots \int \exp \left[-\beta \sum_{i<j} U\left(r_{i j}\right)\right] d \mathbf{r}_1 \ldots d \mathbf{r}_N
$$

can be re-written using the **Mayer function** $f_{i j}=e^{-\beta u\left(r_{i j}\right)}-1$ and  $e^{-\beta \sum_{i<j} U\left(r_{i j}\right)}=\prod_{i<j}\left(1+f_{i j}\right)$ yielding

$$
Z_N=\frac{1}{N!\Lambda^{3 N}} \int \cdots \int \prod_{i<j}\left(1+f_{i j}\right) d \mathbf{r}_1 \ldots d \mathbf{r}_N
$$

## Cluster expansion and second virial

One can expand the product 

$$
\prod_{i<j}\left(1+f_{i j}\right)=1+\sum_{i<j} f_{i j}+\sum_{i<j, k<l}^{\text {distinct }} f_{i j} f_{k l}+\ldots
$$
The first term is the ideal gas, the second is clearly **pair correlations** (only pairwise distances).

The virial expansion can also be represented diagrammatically. For the compressibility factor \( Z_{\rm comp} \), we have:

This motivates one to define $$
B_2(T)=-\frac{1}{2} \int f(r) d \mathbf{r}=-2 \pi \int_0^{\infty}\left[e^{-\beta U(r)}-1\right] r^2 d r
$$


For hard spheres this results in $$
B_2 =  \frac{2\pi}{3} \sigma^3
$$

So $Z = 1 + \dfrac{2\pi}{3} \sigma^3\rho = 1+ 4\left( \dfrac{\pi}{6} \sigma^3\rho\right)=1+4\phi$ as we calculated earlier.

## Low density limit: key points


::: {.callout-important }
- We can simply focus on the **accessible volume** and ignore overlap between **exclusion volumes**
- We can focus on the **configurational entropy** and extract the equation of state relating $P,T,\phi$
- The **compressibility factor** in terms of the packing fraction $\phi$ is the most condensed expression and is $$
Z_{\mathrm{comp}}=\frac{P V}{N k_B T}=1+4 \phi+O\left(\phi^2\right)
$$
    highlighting the first non-trivial perturbation to the ideal gass

- We can see this as an instance of the more general **virial** and **cluster expansion** formalism. which can used for any fluid. $$
Z_{\text {comp }}=1+B_2 \rho+B_3 \rho^2+\ldots
$$

- The first nontrivial correction is the **second virial coefficient** $$
B_2(T)=-2 \pi \int_0^{\infty}\left[e^{-\beta U(r)}-1\right] r^2 d r
$$

## Dense packing

:::{.nonincremental}

- As we increase the packing fraction, the accessible (free) volume reduces rapidly and tehrmal motion is hindered.

- Tight disordered (random) packing of spheres are described as **jammed**: link with glasses (in future lectures).

- Densest packing reaches a maximum packing of around $\phi_{\mathrm{rcp}} \approx 0.64$: this is not unique and depends on the **protocol of preparation**.

- Kepler's conjecture (1611, proved only in 2017):

- Densest packings are **Face Centerd Cubic (FCC) or Hexagonally Cosed Packed (HCP)** $\phi_{\max }=\frac{\pi}{3 \sqrt{2}} \approx 0.74$

## Dense packing

### Q: Can purely replusive spheres spheres assemble spontaneously into an FCC crystal?

:::{.columns style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between;"}

:::{.column style="flex:1; background-color:#d4edda; padding:10px; margin-right:5px;"}
**YES**

- Entropy in AO interactions causes an effective interaction that has a minimum  
- Disordered packings are **less efficient** than ordered ones
:::

:::{.column style="flex:1; background-color:#f8d7da; padding:10px; margin-left:5px;"}
**NO**

- Hard sphere potential only prevents overlaps  
- There is no minimum in the interaction potential to favour a crystal lattice and localisation  
- Entropy is just *disorder*

## Dense packing and crystallisation

Early **computer simulations** ( molecular dynamics, Alder and Wainwright 1957, Monte Carlo, Wood and Jacobson (1957)) proved that that crystalisation is possible.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<video src="figs/melt_freeze.mp4" height="600" controls></video></div>

The video shows a Monte-Carlo simulation at packing $\phi=0.49$ for a small system of 32 particles. Small systems have enhanced fluctuations, leadint to spontaneous freezing and unfreezing.

## Dense packing: cell model

 - In an FCC cell, particles can move very little beyond their own diameter $\sigma$. 
 - Assume that the volume per particle is $v$ and the (geometrically constrained) close packed volume is $v_{cp}$.

- The maximum dispalcement is $$
\delta=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left(\frac{v}{v_{c p}}\right)^{1 / 3}-1\right)
$$ 

- The corresponding free volume is then $v_f=\frac{4 \pi}{3} \delta^3$ from which we can calculate the entropy $$
S = -N k_B T \ln \left(v_f / \Lambda^3\right)$$

- And the pressure $$P=T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{N, T}=\frac{N k_B T}{v_{c p}} \frac{\left(v / v_{c p}\right)^{-2 / 3}}{\left(v / v_{c p}\right)^{1 / 3}-1}$$ 


## Dense packing: cell model



Rearranging and expressing everything in terms of packing fraction $\phi = \dfrac{\pi\sigma^3}{6v}$ yields $$
Z_{\rm comp}=\frac{1}{1-\left(\phi / \phi_{c p}\right)^{1 / 3}}
$$ 


- This expression is **completely different from the low density regime**  $$Z_{\text {comp }}^{\mathrm{low}}=1+B_2 \rho+B_3 \rho^2+\ldots$$

- The incompatibility signal **non-analiticity** and hence a **discontinuous phase transition**: **first order trasnition**.

- First order phase transition are characterised by **interfaces** and **coexistence between phases**.

- We should therefore observe **phase coexistence** in simulations and experiments of hard spheres.


## Colloidal hard spheres: phase behaviour

![Vials of colloidal hard spheres under the effect of sedimentation: the gravitational field imposes a density gradient. At low packing fraction this maintains the dispersed fluid, but when the packing fraction is sufficiently high, it spontaneously forms a crystalline phase (speckled areas) after some time, in coexistence with a fluid. Notice that at ver high packing the interfaces didappear and one has a disordered phase again: it is the glass, see Pusey et al, *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A* (2009). ](./figs/rsta20090181f01.jpg){height=450}

## Colloidal hard spheres: phase behaviour

In conclusion, the one dimensional ohase diagram of hard spheres is the following

![Hard spheres phase diagram](./figs/hard-sphere-diag.svg)

Notice that the the **glass phase** is purely nonequilibrium: if a system has enough time to relax, it will eventually form a **crystal**.

## Beyond hard spheres: simple liquids

:::{.columns}
::: {.column}
- A **simple liquid** is a system of particles interacting via short-range, spherically symmetric (isotropic) pair potentials.

- A very common model is the **Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential** $$U_{\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^6 \right]$$ where $\epsilon$ sets the depth of the potential well (interaction strength) and $\sigma$ is the particle diameter (distance at which $U=0$). 

- The $r^{-12}$ term models steep repulsion, while $r^{-6}$ describes the attractive tail.

- The Lennard-Jones fluid exhibits rich phase behavior: gas, liquid, superciriticla fluid and crystalline solid

- The LJ model is widely used to study atomic and molecular liquids, and serves as a reference for understanding real fluids and their phase transitions.

## Coexistence: Metastability and Instability

:::{.nonincremental}
- Lennard Jones and hards sphere fluid present **coexistence regions**.

- The **binodal** line determines phase coexistence. It is the locus where the free energy satisfies the condition of equal chemical potential and pressure between coexisting phases. When crossing the binodal, one enters a regime of **metastability**.

![Schematic free energy for hard spheres compressed at high pressures: the fluid branch becomes metastable and the free enrgy minimum is located in the crystal phase](./figs/metastable.png){height=400}

:::

## Coexistence: Metastability and Instability
:::{.nonincremental}

- The **spinodal** line marks the boundary of metastability. It is the **limit of stability** $$
\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial \phi^2}=0
$$

- Between the binodal and spinodal lines, the system is metastable, meaning it can persist in a non-equilibrium state for a finite time.

- The nucleation time $\tau$ is related to the free energy barrier $\Delta G^*$ by an activated (also called Arrhenius) law$$
    \tau \propto \exp\left(\frac{\Delta G^*}{k_B T}\right)    $$

- Inside the spinodal there is no nucleation: **coarsening** occurs


You have seen some of this physics when discussing the **Ising model**.
