## Complex fluids and soft condensed matter

- **Soft condensed matter** includes assembllies of colloids, polymers, surfactants, and biological macromolecules and much more.    
    - Term due to Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (Nobel 1991)

- Often, many ofthese are also referred to as **complex fluids**. 
- These materials are **easily deformed** and show complex, disordered structures.
- Their properties are determined by a balance between **energy and entropy**.
- **Thermal fluctuations** play a major role in their behavior.






- Understanding them requires **statistical mechanics** .

## Thermal fluctuations and entropy

- Helmholtz Free energy per particle
$$f = u-Ts$$

- Entropy approximately counts the number of arrangements per particle $s = \dfrac{k_B}{N} \ln{\Omega}$. For hundreds of arrangements per particle one has $s=O(1) k_B$

- **Fluctuations of the internal energy** are on the same scale as **thermal fluctuations**:
$$
\boxed{\Delta u \sim k_B T}
$$
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\Delta u$ indicates standard deviations from the average internal energy.

- Soft matter interactions are mainly **electrostatic**.
- Atomistic details are often unimportant for macroscopic properties.
- **Coarse-graining** simplifies models by focusing on key features:
    - deliberate selection of what matters 
    - systematic integration of a number of degrees of freedom

## Classes of systems
 
In our exploration of soft matter we will focus on six main classes of systems which display different physics:

- colloidal dispersions
- polymeric systems
- liquid crystals
- surfactant aggregates
- arrested systems
- active matter



![Colloidal assemblies, polymers, surfactants, liuqid crystals, glasses and bacteria.](./figs/SYSTEMS.png){ height=300}

## Colloidal dispersions 
::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- **Colloidal dispersions**: small particles (nano–micrometer) suspended in a solvent.
- **Spherical colloids** are common, but many shapes and interactions exist.
- Behave as **"big atoms"**: show Brownian motion, phase transitions, and can form ordered structures.

- **Larger size** and **slower dynamics** make them ideal for direct observation of phenomena like:
    - crystallisation
    - glass formation
    - gel formation

:::
:::

:::

## Polymeric systems 

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Polymers** are long-chain macromolecules made of repeating monomers.
- Their properties result from a balance of **entropy** and **energy**.
- Two main types: **synthetic polymers** (e.g., plastics) and **biopolymers** (e.g., DNA, proteins).
- **Entanglement**: chains cannot cross, leading to unique mechanical behavior.

:::
![Polymer entanglement, from Likhtman and Ponmurugan, *Macromolecules* (2014)](./figs/polymer-entanglement.png)

## Liquid crystals 

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Liquid crystals** form when anisotropic soft matter units (e.g., rod-like or disk-shaped molecules) pack densely, leading to partial order—intermediate between liquids and crystals.

- **Continuum free energy theories** describe liquid crystals by considering the symmetry of their order parameters.
- Liquid crystals are crucial in technologies like **liquid crystal displays (LCDs)**.
:::

## Surfactant aggregates 

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Surfactants** lower surface tension between fluid phases by accumulating at interfaces.
- They are molecules with both **hydrophilic** heads and **hydrophobic** tails.
- Surfactants **self-assemble** at interfaces, forming structures like **bilayers** and **vesicles**.
- These assemblies are essential in **cell biology** and many soft matter systems.
:::

![Cellular membrane](./figs/membrane.jpg){width=100%}

## Arrested systems 

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Arrested systems** are trapped in disordered, non-equilibrium states.
- Lack of long-range order leads to **slow structural relaxation** and prevents reaching the global energy minimum.
- Examples: **glasses**  and **gels**
- These systems exhibit **rigidity, elasticity, and plasticity**: disordered (semi)-solids.
- Relaxation times are **longer than observable timescales**, making equilibrium statistical mechanics insufficient.

:::

## Active matter 

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Active matter**: systems of units that **consume energy** to move or exert forces.
- **Inherently out of equilibrium** due to continuous energy input.
- Includes **biological systems** (bacteria, cells, flocks) and **synthetic systems** (self-propelled colloids).
- Shows **emergent collective behaviors**: swarming, clustering, pattern formation.
- Studied using **hydrodynamic theories** and **agent-based models**.

## IUPAC definition

The  *International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry* (IUPAC) defines 

> **colloidal**:
>The term refers to a state of subdivision, implying that the molecules or polymolecular particles dispersed in a medium have at least in one direction a dimension roughly between 1 nm and 1 $\mu$m  , or that in a system discontinuities are found at distances of that order.

:::{.callout-tip}
# Note
The definition has little to do with the **chemistry** of the polymolecules (i.e. aggregates), but essentially is determined by the **size**.
:::

- *Why the size?*

## Colloidal scale

::: {.nonincremental}
- Particle of size $R$ (micrometric) in medium with  constant collisions at **thermal energy** $\sim 1 k_B T$
- Compare the energy with the potential energy of settling over a length $R$
- Obtain a **nondimensional number** the **gravitational Péclet number**

$$\mathrm{Pe}_g=\frac{\Delta m g R}{k_B T}$$
:::

:::{.fragment}
:::{.callout-note}
## Example

For a **milk protein particle** (casein micelle) in water:

:::{.nonincremental}
- $R \sim 0.5 \, \mu$m (estimate)
- $\Delta m = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \Delta \rho \sim \frac{4}{3}\pi (0.5 \times 10^{-6})^3 \times 200 \sim 1 \times 10^{-16}$ kg (assuming $\Delta \rho \sim 200$ kg/m³)
- $g = 9.8$ m/s²
- $k_B T \sim 4 \times 10^{-21}$ J (room temperature)

$$\mathrm{Pe}_g = \frac{1 \times 10^{-16} \times 9.8 \times 0.5 \times 10^{-6}}{4 \times 10^{-21}} \sim 0.1$$

Since $\mathrm{Pe}_g < 1$, **thermal motion dominates gravity** → particles remain suspended → stable colloid!

:::
:::
:::

## Observation time and stability  {.nostretch}

:::{.nonincremental}

- Any measurement in physics has an **observation time** $t_{\rm obs}$

- Thermal systems have some degree of memory and hence an intrinsic timescale $\tau$ (**relaxation time**)
- When $\tau\ll t_{\rm obs}$ we can take time-averages and consider the system in a stable **steady state**.
- In the absence of net currents, this is an **equilibrium state**

- A colloidal dispersion is stable if it is able to remain dispersed and Brownian time much longer than $t_{\rm obs}$. 

- Instability leads to **aggregation**

## Destabilisation 

- Milk is an emulsion where droplets of fat are dispersed in water and stabilised by proteins. 

- If lemon juice is added, the dispersion medium (water) changes, the pH drops, and the emulsion is *destabilised*. 

- The interactions change → separation of curds (solid) and whey (liquid).

![Curds and whey resulting from the destabilisation of milk, a colloidal emulsion. (Wikimedia)](figs/Curds_and_whey.jpg)


## Which interactions? 

:::{.nonincremental}

- At the colloidal scale: **gravity** and **electrostatics** (eventually **magnetostatics**).
- Electrostatics forces are the main **microscopic** forces: colloids are typically charged
- **Separation of length and timescales**: colloids are much larger and slower than the atomic or molecular constituents of the surrounding fluid.
- Colloid–colloid interactions result from the collective effect (sum or average) of many microscopic interactions, evaluated over times much longer than microscopic relaxation times.
- When we focus on colloidal scales, we **integrate out** the microscopic degrees of freedom (*coarse-graning*)
- Coarse-grained interactions are then obtained and are called **effective interactions**.
