    "text": "Colloidal hard spheres: phase behaviour\n\n\n\nVials of colloidal hard spheres under the effect of sedimentation: the gravitational field imposes a density gradient. At low packing fraction this maintains the dispersed fluid, but when the packing fraction is sufficiently high, it spontaneously forms a crystalline phase (speckled areas) after some time, in coexistence with a fluid. Notice that at very high packing the interfaces disappear and one has a disordered phase again: it is the glass, see Pusey et al, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A (2009)."
